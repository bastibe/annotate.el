        * annotate.el:

        - fixed limit for deleting text-property (the annotation's text).
        - prevented capure of a variable in macro
        'annotate-with-disable-read-only'.
        - fixed procedures to have a clean exit from this mode.
        Toggling annotate-mode (M-x annotate-mode  in a buffer with annotate
        mode active), was not removing the annotation's text.

        Merge pull request #144 from cage2/no-warning-if-no-annotations-save


2022-12-15 cage

        * annotate.el:

        - prevented printing of warning when saving a buffer that has no file
          under the hood and no annotation.
          `annotate-save-annotations' printed  a warning if the  buffer was not
          based on a file's contents. But  the warning was printed even if the
          buffer contained no annotations at all.
          this patch prints the warning about  missing file only if the buffer
          is annotated (i.e. contains at least an annotation).

        * annotate.el:

        - restored annotation of info files.
        - renamed variable to respect a stylistic convention.
        - do not skip 'annotate--remove-annotation-property' for narrowed
        buffer.
        Previously  the   function  above  just  skipped   narrowed  buffer,
        effectively preventing delete of  annotation's text. This patch just
        prevent the  function to try  to move  the cursor beyond  the buffer
        limit that would leads to a crash.
        The  test  for  narrowed  buffer was  added  because  command  like:
        'comment-dwim' narrows the buffer beyond  the curtains, but my patch
        was too  radical, this  changes supposed to  fix annotation  of info
        files and does not interferes with 'comment-dwim'.

2021-05-27  cage

        * annotate.el:

	- fixed annotated text shown in the summary window

	When an annotated buffer (that is  visiting a file) is modified in
	a way that  changes the position of an annotation  in that buffer,
	showing the  summary window -without  saving the file  first- will
	read the  annotation using the  updated position but will  get the
	contents from the  outdated file; this gives wrong  results in the
	text  annotation  parts of  the  summary  windows, with  the  text
	shifted from  the correct  position.  This patch  try to  fix this
	bug.

2021-05-26  cage

        * annotate.el:

	- fixed  callback for  "[replace]" button  in summary  window; the

2021-04-30  cage

        * annotate.el:

	- prevented calling 'annotate--remove-annotation-property' on a
	narrowed buffer.

	For some reason (perhaps related to font-locking?) comment-region
	command was calling this function, the fact is that the command
	narrows the buffer before actually adding comments, so the call to
	`point' inside the annotate--remove-annotation-property's body may
	fall outside of the buffer raising an error. This patch prevents
	calling this function on narrowed buffer.

2021-02-05  cage

        * annotate.el:

	- fixed 'annotate-previous-annotation-ends'

	'annotate-previous-annotation-ends'  scans   the  buffer  contents
	backward looking for an annotation before a buffer position
        (let's' call this position 'POS').

	If an annotation exists on 'POS' the backward search starts from a
	position less than the starts of said annotation.

	But unfortunately in the local function
	'annotate-previous-annotation-ends' the test to stop the searching
	is wrong.

	This is the code for the local function:

	----

	(cl-labels ((previous-annotation-ends (start)
	  (let ((annotation (annotate-annotation-at start)))
	    (while (and (/= start (point-min))
                        (null annotation))
              (setf start (previous-overlay-change start))
	      (setf annotation (annotate-annotation-at start)))
            annotation))))

	----

	Let's   assume  that   the  annotation   under  'POS'   starts  at
	(point-min), of course this is  the first annotation of the buffer
	and the function should returns nil.

	Then the initial value of  'start' (argument of the local function
	above) is one less the starting  of the annotation under 'POS' and
	-in  this  case-  values  0   (when  '(point-min)'  values  1)  no
	annotations can exist  at 0 and, moreover,  (/= start (point-min))
	is  non nil;  therefore the  test passes  and the  results of  the
	function  is  the  annotation  under the  position  'start'  where
	'start' get the value of (previous-overlay-change start)).

	The latter expression '(previous-overlay-change start)' return the
	position in  the buffer where there  is a change in  an overlay or
	(point-min)  if no  change in  overlay exists;  in the  case under
	examination the  expression returns (point-min) as  the annotation
	under 'POS' is the first in the buffer.

	In conclusion, the function returns  the annotation under 'POS' as
	the annotation that supposed to starts before the annotation under
	'POS', instead of nil!

	To reproduce the bug:

	buffer contents
	****
	****
	^^^
	annotate this portion of the buffer

	****
	*aaa

	then annotate all the non-annotated text.

	AAAA
	Aaaa

	The coloring  of the highlight of  the two annotation will  be the
	same (wrong) while the background  color of the annotation text is
	not (which is correct).

2021-01-15  cage

        * annotate.el:

	- added checking encrypted (GPG) file format.

	In many parts  of the code we  use 'annotate-guess-file-format', a
	function that  try to guess the  format of the file  that produced
	the  contents of  a buffer.

	Sometimes (for example  buffers that shows info  nodes) this check
	is  very   expensive  because   involves  reading   (and  possibly
	decompress  or even  decrypt) the  file contents  and check  for a
	regular expression.

	If  we  could know  in  advance  that  the file  is  symmetrically
	encrypted with GPG we could  skip other, more expensive checks for
	guessing file format (like info files).

        * annotate.el:

	-   moved  'save-match-data'   from   the   function  that   calls
	'annotate--split-lines' inside  the body of the  latter; to remove
	any side-effect.

2020-12-19  cage

        * annotate.el:

	- added procedures to pad multiline annotation text.

2020-12-18  cage

        * annotate.el:

	- extracted  local function  and taken  into account  info node
        names (that should not be expanded).

2020-12-18  cage

        * annotate.el:

	-  stored abbreviated  filenames for  the path  component of  each
	record of the annotations database; - improved a docstring.

2020-12-16 cage

	* Changelog, NEWS.org, annotate.el:

	Updated version and documentations.

2020-12-07  cage

        * README.org, annotate.el:

	- fixed more typos.

2020-12-01  cage

        * README.org, annotate.el:

	- allow overwriting (even partial)  of annotations.  That is, user
	can place an annotation on top of an already existing one. The new
	will  delete  overlapped  portion  of the  old  annotation.   This
	feature    should   not    allow   to    break   an    annotation,
	though. Annotations can not overlaps.

	- added a new customizable variable:

        'annotate-warn-if-hash-mismatch'  when  nil  prevent  printing  of
	warning  when annotation  database's'  hash and  file  has do  not
	match;

	- fixed bug  in alternating coloring of  annotation and underlined
	text;

	- updated README;

	- fixed some typos.

2020-11-22  cage

        * annotate.el:

	- added more docstrings.

2020-11-12  cage

        * annotate.el:

	- prevented getting shared value for 'annotate-file' in
        '%load-annotation-data'.

	This  way  we can  ensure  that  'annotate-file' can  be  declared
	buffer-local and  different annotation  databases can be  used from
	different buffers.

2020-11-11  cage

        * annotate.el:
	- fitted 'annotate-position-inside-chain-p' into   'annotate--position-inside-annotated-text-p';
	- fixed some typos.

2020-11-06  cage

        * annotate.el:

	- Fixed a regression  and some bugs related to
        incorrect calculation of of multiline annotations.

	To reproduce the bugs:

	legend:

	a = annotated text
	* = non annotated text

	- First bug

	Create a multiline annotation using region.

	aaaa
	aaaa
	aaaa    ####

	Place the cursor as below.

	aaaa
	^ cursor
	aaaa
	aaaa    ####

	type a character

	a****
	aaaa
	aaaa    ####

	The annotated text has a "gap"

	Fix proposed: revert to the old (correct behaviour)

	Second bug

	aaaa
	aaaa
	aaaa    ####

	Place the cursor as below.

	aaaa
	^ cursor on the first column
	aaaa
	aaaa    ####

	type some text

	***
	aaa
	aaa    ####

	Save (C-x C-s)

	you  get an  error  on  the echo  area:  "let*:  Wrong type  argument:
	overlayp, nil" and the annotations are not correctly saved.

	Fix proposed: remove the offending code.

	Third bug

	a multiline bug as before

	aaaa
	aaaa
	aaaa    ####

	place the cursor here:

	aaaa
	aaaa
	^ cursor
	aaaa    ####

	type some text

	aaaa
	*****
	aaaa    ####

	Then annotate the same line (C-c C-a):

	aaaa
	aaaa    ####
	aaaa    ####

	we  introduced  a  annotation  in  the gap  of  the  already  existing
	multiline annotation.

	Fix proposed: prevents annotating text inside an annotation.

2020-09-29
        * README.org, annotate.el
	- updated README;
	- increased version;
	- updated NEWS and Changelog.

2020-09-22
        * annotate.el
	- added   command   'annotate-summary-of-file-from-current-pos';
	this command shows a summary window that contains the annotation
	in the  active buffer  that appears after  the cursor  position;
	- added docstrings.

2020-09-20
        * annotate.el
	- fixed indentation.

2020-09-20
        * annotate.el
	- Using "help-echo" to print annotations instead of render it on the
        buffer.
	This feature is optional and can be activated using the
        customizable variable 'annotate-use-echo-area'

2020-09-20
        * README.org
	- Removed internal link because of issue #79.

2020-08-11
	* annotate.el (annotate-annotate, annotate-load-annotation-data
	               annotate-create-annotation, annotate-summary-query-parse-note,
                       annotate-switch-db)

	- Added errors conditions signalling to some functions.

2020-07-01
	* annotate.el (annotate-change-annotation)

	- ensured that the modified status of as buffer is not modified by the local
	function 'delete' in 'annotate-change-annotation';
	- added dependency on 'info'.

2020-06-26
	* annotate.el (annotate-switch-db)
	- Added file argument 'database-file-path',
	  this could help people calling this function in a non interactive
	  way from their code;
	- fixed some typos in documentation and comments.

2020-06-09 Bastian Bechtold, cage
	* annotate.el (annotate-buffers-annotate-mode, annotate-switch-db)
	- added functions to switch the database of annotations used for the emacs session;
	- increased version to 0.8.0

2020-05-18 Bastian Bechtold, cage
	* annotate.el
	- Increased version to 0.7.0 for stable release

2020-01-25 Bastian Bechtold, cage

        * annotate.el (annotate-annotation-force-newline-policy,
                       annotate-annotation-newline-policy-forced-p,
                       annotate-create-annotation,
                       annotate-lineate,
                       annotate-summary-delete-annotation-button-pressed):
        - mitigated bug that prevented rendering of annotation in
          org-mode forcing 'newline' policy for annotation
          positioning.
          See the local function
          'maybe-force-newline-policy' in 'annotate-create-annotation'.
        - chosen the window that contains the current buffer when resizing the annotations
          see variable 'current-window' in 'annotate-lineate';
        - redraw buffer if one of its annotations is deleted
          operating from the summary window.
          see: 'annotate-summary-delete-annotation-button-pressed'.

        * annotate.el (annotate--font-lock-matcher):
        - fixed error for regexp search
        Sometimes some modes/package puts overlay on the last character of a
        buffer (notably SLIME when the parenthesis of a form are not
        balanced). This will make 're-search-forward' in the aforementioned
        function fails and font lock becomes a mess (e.g. text color
        disappears).

2020-02-10 Bastian Bechtold, cage
        * annotate.el (annotate--font-lock-matcher annotate-bounds annotate-symbol-strictly-at-point annotate-next-annotation-change annotate-previous-annotation-change annotate-clear-annotations annotate-annotate)
        - prevented fails of fontification of annotated regions
        As we walk across the overlays we can get past the limit;
        - mark buffer as modified even if the only action the user performed
        was clearing annotation (and at least an annotation was present in
        the file)
        - prevented annotation of text marked with a region that overlap with
        an existing annotation.

2020-03-06 Bastian Bechtold, cage
        * annotate.el (annotate-annotation-force-newline-policy annotate-annotation-newline-policy-forced-p annotate-summary-delete-annotation-button-pressed annotate--annotation-builder)

        - used  an heuristic  to force newline  policy when  the annotated
        text  does  not  uses a  standard  fonts  (using  font  height  as
        comparison);

        -  when, in  summary  window,  the delete  button  is pressed  the
        software take care of reload  annotate mode for the visited buffer
        the annotation button is referring to;

        - when re-flowing annotation the window width was calculated always
        for the current buffer (the one with the focus).

2020-03-06 Bastian Bechtold, cage
        * annotate.el

        - each annotation (the overlay, actually) now has a property 'position
          and its  value indicates which  positions the annotations holds  in a
          "chain"  of  annotations.

          Even  if  rendered separately  each  chain  represents a  single
          annotation.

          The last annotation in the chain has position's value equal to -1.

          If  the set  of a  group/chain  is formed  by only  one element  the
          position's value is -1 as well.

          Please note that this changes impacted more or less the whole
          package's code.

2020-03-16 Bastian Bechtold, cage
        * annotate.el (annotate-annotate)

	- fixed annotation picking in 'annotate-annotate'
          at  the  beginning  of  the  function we  was  picking  the  first
	  available  overlay.   So  the annotated  text  contained  multiple
	  overlays and an  annotation was not the first we  missed the last,
	  This means, for example, that the annotation was not modifiable.
2020-03-16 Bastian Bechtold, cage
        * annotate.el (annotate-create-annotation)

	- fixed managing return value of
	"(get-text-property changed-face-pos 'face)"

	When finding  the face of a portion  of buffer, to try to  get the right
	positioning   of   the    annotation,   using:

	"(get-text-property changed-face-pos 'face)"

	the code  assumed this function returned  a symbol (the face  of the
	text) or nil: this is  incorrect according to the documentation; the
	code above can returns a symbol, a plist or even list of symbols.
