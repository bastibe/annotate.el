* introduction

This  package provides  a minor  mode ~annotate-mode~,  which can  add
annotations   to   arbitrary   files  without   changing   the   files
themselves. This is very useful for code reviews. When ~annotate-mode~
is active, ~C-c C-a~ will create, edit, or delete annotations.

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bastibe/annotate.el/master/example.png]]

* Usage

** Quick start

With an  active region, ~C-c  C-a~ creates  a new annotation  for that
region. With no active region, ~C-c C-a~ will create an annotation for
the word  under point. If point  is on an annotated  region, ~C-c C-a~
will edit that  annotation instead of creating a new  one. Typing ~C-c
C-d~ or clearing the annotation deletes them.

Use ~C-c ]~ to jump to the next  annotation and ~C-c [~ to jump to the
previous annotation.

** Metadata

The  current  database  for  annotations  is  contained  in  the  file
indicated by the variable ~annotate-file~ (=~/.emacs.d/annotations= by
default) but  each user can change  this value in a  dynamic way using
the  command ~annotate-switch-db~.   This  command will  take care  to
refresh/redraw   all   annotations   in    the   buffers   that   uses
~annotate-mode~.

The database holds the hash of each  annotated file so it can print a
warning if the file has been modified outside Emacs (for example).

Warning     can     be     suppressed     setting     the     variable
~annotate-warn-if-hash-mismatch~ to nil.

Please note that switching database,  in this context, means rebinding
the  aforementioned variable  (~annotate-file~).  This  means than  no
more than a single database can be active for each Emacs session.

To use multiple database in the same Emacs session ~annotate-file~ should be made
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Buffer_002dLocal-Variables.html][buffer-local]],
see:
[[https://github.com/bastibe/annotate.el/issues/68][this thread]] and, in particular
[[https://github.com/bastibe/annotate.el/issues/68#issuecomment-728218022][this message]].

If an  empty annotation database  (in memory) is saved  the database
file  is deleted  instead, if  ~annotate-database-confirm-deletion~ is
non  nil (the  default) a  confirmation action  is asked  to the  user
before actually remove the file from the file system.

Users of
[[https://github.com/emacscollective/no-littering][no-littering]]
can take advantage of its packages generated files management.

** keybindings

*** ~C-c  C-a~ (function annotate-annotate)
    Creates  a new annotation  for that
    region. With no active region, ~C-c C-a~ will create an annotation for
    the word  under point. If point  is on an annotated  region, ~C-c C-a~
    will edit that annotation instead of  creating a new one. Clearing the
    annotation deletes them.

    If ~annotate-annotation-confirm-deletion~ is  non nil (the default
    is *nil*) a confirmation action is asked, using ~y-or-n-p~, to the
    user before actually remove the annotation.

    If point  is the newline  character and the  customizable variable
    ~annotate-endline-annotate-whole-line~ is not  nil (default is non
    nil)  the whole  line is  annotated (or  the next  if the  line is
    empty).

    If the line contains a single annotation that cover all the line
    annotating the newline Will ask to edit the annotation. If
    `annotate-endline-annotate-whole-line' is nil annotating a newline
    will signal an error.

     - ~annotate-endline-annotate-whole-line~;
     - ~annotate-highlight-secondary~;
     - ~annotate-highlight~.

*** ~C-c C-d~
    Delete an annotation under point, if such annotation exists.

    If ~annotate-annotation-confirm-deletion~ is  non nil (the default
    is *nil*) a confirmation action is asked, using ~y-or-n-p~, to the
    user before actually remove the annotation.

**** related customizable variable
     - ~annotate-annotation-confirm-deletion~.

*** ~C-c ]~ (function annotate-goto-next-annotation)
    Jump to the next  annotation.

*** ~C-c [~ (function annotate-goto-previous-annotation)
    Jump to the previous annotation.

*** ~C-c C-s~ (function annotate-show-annotation-summary)
    Show summary window.

    A window with a list of annotated files together with their
    annotations is shown. If ~annotate-summary-ask-query~ is non nil
    (default is ~t~) then a prompt is shown where the user can insert
    a query to filter the annotation database, see "Query Language"
    below.

    The summary window allow editing and removing of annotation using
    the provided buttons.

    The annotation text can be pressed to and will open the annotated
    file, placing the cursor at the point where the corresponding
    annotated text appears.

     - ~annotate-summary-ask-query~.

* Exporting

Annotations can be exported ~annotate-export-annotations~ as commented
unified diffs, like this:

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bastibe/annotate.el/master/diff-example.png]]

Alternatively, they can be integrated ~annotate-integrate-annotations~
as comments into the current buffer, like this:

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bastibe/annotate.el/master/integrate-example.png]]

     - ~annotate-integrate-marker~
     - ~annotate-diff-export-options~
     - ~annotate-integrate-highlight~
     - ~annotate-fallback-comment~

* Alternative visualization of annotations

For typographically difficult scenarios (or just because you prefer
it), such as variable-width fonts or overlay-heavy modes, the default
visualization system that renders the annotation into the buffer could
not properly works.

In this case the users can switch to a "pop-up" style annotation
setting to a non-nil value the variable ~annotate-use-echo-area~.

When such variable's value is not null, moving the mouse pointer over
the annotated text will temporary show the annotation.

The actual visuals of this "pop-up" can be different depending of your
system's setup (see
[[https://github.com/bastibe/annotate.el/pull/81][this pull request]]
for a couple of examples.

Another alternative way to show annotations is provided by the command:
~annotate-summary-of-file-from-current-pos~.

Calling this command will show a summary window that prints all the
annotations related to annotated text that appears (in the active
buffer) beyond the current cursor position.

* Other commands

** annotate-switch-db

This command will ask the user for a new annotation database files,
load it and refresh all the annotations contained in each buffer where
annotate minor mode is active.

See the docstring for more information and
[[https://github.com/bastibe/annotate.el/issues/68][this thread]]
for a possible workflow where this command could be useful.

* More documentation

 Please check ~M-x customize-group RET annotate~ as there is
 extensive documentation for each customizable variable.

* BUGS

** Known bugs

   - Annotations in org-mode source blocks will be underlined, but the
     annotations don't show up. This is likely a fundamental
     incompatibility with the way source blocks are highlighted and the
     way annotations are displayed.

   - Because   of  a   limitation  in   the  Emacs   display  routines
     ~scroll-down-line~ could get stuck on a annotated line. So no fix
     can  be  provided by  the  authors  of ~annotate.el~,  a  possible
     workaround is to call the command with a numeric prefix equals to
     one plus the number of  annotation text lines below the annotated
     text.

     For example:

     #+BEGIN_SRC text
     foo bar baz
     annotation
     #+END_SRC

     needs a prefix of 2: ~C-u 2 M-x scroll-down-line~

     But note that:

     #+BEGIN_SRC text
     foo bar baz   annotation
     #+END_SRC

     Needs no prefix.

   - Deleting the first  character of an annotated text  will remove the
     annotation (this turned out to be useful, though).

* Query Language

  The summary window can shows  results filtered by criteria specified
  with a very simple query language, the basis syntax for that language
  is shown below:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
 [file-mask] [(and | or) [not] regex-note [(and | or) [not] regexp-note ...]]
#+END_SRC

where

  - file-mask :: is a regular expression that should match the path of file
    the annotation refers to;
  - and, or, not :: you guess? Classics logical operators;
  - regex-note :: the text of annotation must match this regular expression.

** Examples

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  lisp$ and TODO
#+END_SRC

   matches the text ~TODO~ in all lisp files

Parenthesis can be used for the expression related to the text of
annotation, like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
 lisp$ and (TODO or important)
#+END_SRC

   the same as above but checks also for string `important'

#+BEGIN_SRC text
 /home/foo/
#+END_SRC
   matches all the annotation that refers to file in the directory
   ~/home/foo~

#+BEGIN_SRC text
 /home/foo/ and not minor
#+END_SRC

   matches all the annotation that refers to file in the directory
   ~/home/foo~ and that not contains the text ~minor~.

#+BEGIN_SRC text
 .* and "not"
#+END_SRC
 the quotation mark (") can be used to escape strings.

As a shortcut, an empty query will match everything (just press
~return~ at prompt).

* FAQ
  Sometimes the package does not respect the customizable variable's value of
  ~annotate-annotation-position-policy~, is this a bug?

  No  it is  not, when  a line  which is  using a  non default  font is
  annotated  the software  force  the ~:new-line~  policy,  that is  the
  annotation will be  displayed on a new line regardless  of the value
  of the variable mentioned in the question.

  This is necessary  to prevent the annotation to be  pushed beyond the
  window limits if an huge font is used by the annotated text.
