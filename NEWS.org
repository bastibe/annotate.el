  - prevented loss of undo tree when annotations is modified;
  - positioning of annotation is customizable;
  - added a summary window to display annotations; the summary results

  - annotated text on the same lines are highlighted with two
    different, alternating, colors;
  - annotate try to check file modifications using checksum and warns

  - fixed some bugs in fontifications of multiline annotation;
  - when the only user interactions, before saving, with a visited file was
    the call of 'annotate-clear-annotations' the annotations
    will shows again at reload, this should be fixed now.

  - Partially fixed bug that prevented annotation of buffer when org-mode was used;

- 2020-11-20 V0.9.2 Bastian Bechtold, cage ::

  This version fix a regression and  some more bug that could breaks a
  multiline  annotation  in  ways  that makes  the  annotation  system
  inconsistent  and  renders the  annotated  text  in wrong  way  (for
  details see the Changelog).

  The 'annotate-file' can be now  safely declared buffer-local so that
  multiple databases of annotations can be used on a per-buffer basis.

  For practical applications see:

  https://github.com/bastibe/annotate.el/issues/68

  Many thanks to gopar for spotting  this elusive bug and help testing
  the patch! :)

- 2020-12-16 V1.0.0 Bastian Bechtold, cage ::

  This version  allow overwrite of notes.  That is, user can  place an
  annotation on  top of an already  existing one. The new  will delete
  overlapped portion of the old annotation.

  Also a new  customizable variable ('annotate-warn-if-hash-mismatch')
  has  been  added.   When  nil   prevent  printing  of  warning  when
  annotation database's' hash and file has do not match;

  Also a problem with adjacent annotation's coloring has been fixed.

- 2020-12-24 V1.1.0 Bastian Bechtold, cage ::

  This version  improves the  visual style of  annotated text  that if
  formed by more than one line.

  Also  the file  path  of each  annotated file  (in  the database  of
  annotation)     is    saved     so    called     abbreviated    form
  (e.g. '/home/user/foo' is saved as  '~/foo', this could be useful if
  the database is migrated from one machine to another.

  This  improvements has  been suggested  by  the user  Ran that  also
  helped testing this new version of the package. Thank you!

  Finally import and export of annotation has been fixed.

  Related to the last  fix the variable ~annotate-diff-export-context~
  has been removed.

- 2021-01-06 V1.1.1 Bastian Bechtold, cage ::

  This version  fix an old bug  that causes many types  of issues with
  rendering of annotations on the margin of the window.

- 2021-01-06 V1.1.2 Bastian Bechtold, cage ::

  This  version improves  visual  of multilined  notes  placed on  the
  window margins.

- 2021-01-06 V1.1.3 Bastian Bechtold, cage ::

  Optimized the code to speedup  reading and saving of encrypted (with
  GPG) annotated files.

- 2021-02-05 V1.1.4 Bastian Bechtold, cage ::

  Fixed highlight color  of annotated text that starts  from the first
  character of the buffer's content.

- 2021-03-17 V1.1.5 Bastian Bechtold, cage ::

  Removed compilation  warnings, one of  the problem highlighted  by a
  warning was actually preventing this package working on Doom Emacs.

  Also a  bug that prevented  annotations placed  on info files  to be
  deleted has been fixed.

  Many thanks  to many people  that helped discovering  and suggesting
  fix for these problems!

- 2021-04-27 V1.2 Bastian Bechtold, cage ::

  New feature. When the customizable variable
  `annotate-endline-annotate-whole-line' is not nil (default t), and
  and the user try to annotate a newline the whole line is annotated
  instead (or the next if the line is empty).

  If the line contains a single annotation that cover all the line
  annotating the newline Will ask to edit the annotation. If
  `annotate-endline-annotate-whole-line' is nil annotating a newline
  will signal an error.

  Also this version generates smaller database as files left with no
  annotations will not be saved on disk.

  Finally   annotating   read-only    buffers   (especially   deleting
  annotations) should works without problems.

- 2021-05-05 V1.2.1 Bastian Bechtold, cage ::

  This version fixes a bug that prevented command like
  'comment-region' to works properly when annotate-mode was active.

- 2021-05-07 V1.3.0 cage ::

  This version  added a procedure to  prevent an empty database  to be
  saved on the user's disk.

  Moreover if an  empty annotations database is going  to overwrite an
  existing stale database file on disk the file is deleted instead.

  Before  deleting the  old database  file a  confirmation message  is
  printed    on    the    minibuffer   if    the    custom    variable
  'annotate-database-confirm-deletion' is non nil (default: t).

- 2021-05-27 V1.3.1 cage ::

  Bugfix release:

  - The  button "[replace]"  to edit  an annotation  from the  summary
    window was not working at all;

  - In certain  cases the  summary window  was rendering  wrong text's
    fragment instead of the text of the annotation.

  Many thanks  to "glvno"  for reporting  the aforementioned  bugs and
  testing the patches!

- 2021-09-24 v1.4.2 cage ::

  This  version added  a new  command to  delete the  annotation under
  cursor.

- 2021-09-30 v1.4.3 cage ::

  This  is a bugfix release.

  The  program  would  keep  asking to  confirmation  for  deleting  a
  database  file even  if such  file does  not actually  exists on  the
  file system.

  When the  only action on  a buffer  was deleting an  annotation, the
  buffer was  not marked as  modified; as a consequence,  the deletion
  would  not happens  on  the  database (the  database  entry for  the
  annotation to  be deleted would not  be removed from the  file) and,
  when visiting the file, the annotation would be shown again.
